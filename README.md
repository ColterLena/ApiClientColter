# Api Client: A C# and .NET Exercise Using APIs
In this project, you will practice accessing an API. You'll see how an API request is made from code, and see how data is returned from an API.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate usage of APIs
- Understand how an API request is sent.
- Understand the request and response for an API.

## Requirements

- [ ] TOP TIP: Choose an API that has a simple, less nested API. Perhaps one that just returns an array of one-level-deep objects. This will make your task_significantly_ easier.
- [ ] Choose one of the APIs from [this list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) that does not request "AUTH" (Authorization) since an API that requires authorization is a little more difficult to use when first learning. I have also selected some sample APIs that will be good choices:

- [ ] After choosing your API **read** the documentation.
- [ ] Create a new `sdg-console` application for accessing the API.
- [ ] Create a class to store information that comes back from your API.
- [ ] Write code to query the API and show results.
- [ ] If your API has more than one endpoint (URL) support a few options,
      perhaps by creating a menu system in your application.
